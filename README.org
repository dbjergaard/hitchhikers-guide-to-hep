* DON'T PANIC
** A Hitchhiker's guide to High Energy Physics
** Introduction
Welcome to High Energy Physics.  Like the Galaxy, HEP is a wonderful
and mysterious place filled with amazing things.  The intent of this
guide is to provide a jump-start to HEP research.  Its purpose is to
be entertaining an un-informative.  If you find the guide
educational, the editors kindly request that you send an edit which
suitable obfuscates what you found enlightening.  The road you are on
is one of enlightenment, and you can't be enlightened unless you are
first darkened.

If you find this guide next to useless and think it would be better
served as toilet paper in its printed form, the please send a bottle
of Old Janx Spirit to the editor of that section.

The Guide is not intended to be read linearly.  Jump to the section
you need, and if that section contains links to other sections, then
please see above regarding edits. 

*NOTE* If you are reading this on github, a link to another section
will probably be broken due to a bug in how github parses org-flavored
markdown.  It is better to open this guide in emacs and follow links
with "C-c C-o".

** For Windows Hitchhikers
While it is possible to practice HEP from the comfort of Bill Gates'
brain child, it is not recommended by The Guide editors.  (They don't
run Windows anyway, daylight scares them.) If you insist on using
Windows, the following is a list of useful software.
*** Software you will need
- [[*For%20Linux%20Hitchhikers][For Linux Hitchhikers]]
- [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html][PuTTY (ssh client for Windows)]]: Secure SHell is the standard way of
  accessing *nix machines remotely.  PuTTY is the Windows client for
  this. 
- ROOT (Not for the faint of heart)
- [[http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/][Xming an X11 server for Windows]]: This allows you to tunnel X11
  applications (ROOT's histogram interface) to your windows desktop,
  this way your data (and ROOT) can live on a remote machine, but you
  can still interact with them as if they were on your desktop.  (You
  need a *fast* internet connection to do this)
- [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]]: Allows you to boot operating systems within operating
  systems (useful if you don't want to dual boot Ubuntu) see [[*For%20Linux%20Hitchhikers][For Linux
  Hitchhikers]] after you've setup a working distro.
[[http://www.calebmadrigal.com/running-ubuntu-virtualbox/][See here]] for a nice picture-book tutorial on installing Ubuntu
through VirtualBox on windows.
** For Linux Hitchhikers
*** Software you will need
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/][Screen]]: This lets you pick up where you left off if your ssh
   connection drops, [[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gnu_screen/][here]] is a good conceptual introduction
 - [[http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-root-source][ROOT]]: The industry standard for High Energy Physics analysis.
   Beware: this program uses an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Infinite_Improbability_Drive][Infinite Improbability Drive]] to
   perform analysis.  
 - [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting][BASH]]: The command shell of choice for ATLAS Physicists.  You may
   think you could use ZSH, but its better just to stick with
   what everyone else uses.  CMS Physicists prefer TCSH for some
   weird reason.
 - [[*Editors][Editor]]: Choose you're religion wisely, it will eventually permeate
   your being and change the way you approach life in general.

*** Software you will need
** Editors
Like the major world religions, there are also major editors.  In
the *nix ecosystem there are to main editors, emacs and vim. There are
others, but they are many, and beyond the scope of this guide.  

The most important thing to do after [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430164/differences-between-emacs-and-vim][choosing an editor]] is to work
through its corresponding tutorial.  An oft heard recommendation is
that "emacs is easier to learn than vi(m)".  True enlightenment in
either of these editors is roughly the same after completing the
corresponding tutorial.  

*** Finding an editor Guru
After you have finished the tutorial for your editor of choice, then
its time to find a guru.  Guru's are best located by asking around.
If you are talking with someone and notice they use your editor,
don't be afraid to ask them how they did something. Most of the time
the Guru will be flattered and may even volunteer to help you with
any other editor related questions.  
**** Editor Guru etiquette
While it is generally OK to ask your Guru any editor related
question, it is best to keep questions restricted to the editor in
question.  Flame wars have been fought for decades over which is the
"one true editor." 

In order to prevent a faux pas, it is best to make sure you know which
editor your guru uses.  This is especially true in the case of a
vi(m) or emacs guru. 

Another thing to be careful of is repeatedly asking basic questions.
Again, some gurus will tolerate this at the beginning, but after a
point the guru expects you to master the basics (on your own). The
most valuable knowledge your guru can impart is not written in the
tutorial that came with the editor.
**** Keeping your Guru happy
Guru's subsist mainly on a liquid diet of caffeinated beverages
during the day and beer (occasionally wine) at night.  It is
important that your Guru remain well lubricated. It is generally
considered a good gesture to offer your Guru his/her beverage of
choice if you've found him/her to be especially helpful on your path
to enlightenment.

Calm down, take a deep breath and read the first line of The Guide.
Then come back here.  Somewhere a fellow grad student has a copy of
"Introduction to Elementary Particles (2nd Edition)" by David
Griffiths.  Read Chapter 6 in entirety paying special note to the
footnote on page 205.
