<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Welcome to High Energy Physics.  Like the Galaxy, HEP is a wonderful
and mysterious place filled with amazing things.  The intent of this
guide is to provide a jump-start to HEP research.  Its purpose is to
be entertaining and uninformative.  The information in this guide was
hard won, The Editor does not intend it to be different for our dear
reader.  This guide is not intended to make the reader's life easier.
It is not intended to teach anything.  It is intended to provide the
dear reader with a glossary of concepts for further research.
</p>

<p>
If the reader finds this guide entertaining, but uninformative, then
please send a bottle of Old Janx Spirit to The Editor. The Guide is
not intended to be read linearly.  Jump to the section in need, and if
that section contains links to other sections, then please see above
regarding edits. Prepare to be frustrated.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
A note on key notation: Keys sequences follow the "emacs" style for
notating keys.  Therefore "<code>C-c</code>" means hold down the control key,
while pressing the <code>c</code> key. "<code>M-a</code>" would mean hold down the "Meta" key
and press the <code>a</code> key.  On most keyboards the Meta key is the key
labeled "Alt".  There is also the "Super" key, on most PC keyboards
this key has the "Windows icon" on it.  The function keys 1-12 are
notated as <code>F1</code> etc.  The escape key is usually notated <code>ESC</code>, and
the enter key is notated <code>RET</code> for Return.  A sequence is denoted by
a series of keys and spaces or dashes.  A dash means hold the two
keys at the same time, a space means release the previous keys and
continue with the next instruction.  Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"<code>C-c C-a</code>" Control-C release Control-A
</li>
<li>"<code>C-c a</code>" Control-c release A
</li>
<li>"<code>C-M-f</code>" Press Control, then Meta, then F without releasing
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The online version of the guide includes a Table of Contents; simply
mouse over it and a full list of topics will pop up.  You can click
any topic to jump to that section.  If you read this in org-mode, the
file will open folded.  It will look like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+TITLE: DON'T PANIC
#+AUTHOR: David Bjergaard
#+EMAIL: david.b@duke.edu
#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:nil toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t -:t f:t *:t &lt;:t

#+LaTeX_CLASS: article

 * A Hitchhiker's guide to High Energy Physics...
</pre>
<p>
Place your cursor at the beginning of <code>* A Hitchhiker's...</code> and hit
<code>TAB</code>, this will expand the topics allowing you to see and over-view
of the document.  Move to whichever topic you're interested in and
hit <code>TAB</code> again to expand that section.  
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this in Vim without <a href="https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode">Vim-OrgMode</a>, then you will
have no folding and the whole document will be expanded.  Jump to
various headlines by searching for "<code>**</code>" (two levels deep),
"<code>***</code>" (three levels deep), "<code>****</code>" (four levels deep), etc.  
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this as a PDF, there is no Table of Contents. Just
scroll to the section you are interested in.  
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b> If you are reading this on GitHub, a link to another section
will probably be broken due to a bug in how GitHub parses org-flavored
markdown.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
You will, regardless of which operating system you use, be typing
commands into a terminal.  It's inevitable, powerful, and intimidating
to new users.  HEP hitchhikers should feel at home.  Proficiency with
the command line is essential to being a functioning HEP researcher.
</p>

<p>
The terminal is like the Galaxy Hitchhiker's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker%2527s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Towels">utility towel</a>. Every
hitchhiker needs a terminal, and each hitchhiker customizes his or

<h5 id="sec-1-3-2-1">Line Editing</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-2-1">
<p>
Most modern operating systems' default shell is bash.  Be aware that
bash's line editor is set up to respect emacs keybindings, this means
"C-a" is beginning of line "C-e" the end, etc. You can change to vi
bindings by typing:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">set -o vi
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you forget which mode your in, check it by typing:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">set -o
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you want these changes to be permanent, add them to your <code>.bashrc</code>.
If these commands give you an error, type:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">echo $SHELL
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And see what it says (<code>/bin/bash</code> if it's bash, may be <code>/bin/zsh</code> or
<code>/bin/tcsh</code>). If it is not bash, then you need to google information
for the line editor of whichever shell you are using.

<h5 id="sec-1-3-2-2">Managing Jobs</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-2-2">
<p>
Sometimes it will be convenient to spawn a process and continue
working in the current shell.  Usually this is accomplished by
redirecting the stdout and stderr to a file:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 42 &amp;&gt; theProcess.log &amp;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When you launch the command, you'll see something like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[1] 19509
</pre>
<p>
The number <code>19509</code> is the PID of the process.  If you have multiple
jobs going they can be summarized by typing <code>jobs</code>
</p>
<pre class="example">
[1]   Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 42 &amp;&gt; theProcess.log &amp;
[2]-  Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 41 &amp;&gt; theProcess.log &amp;
[3]+  Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 40 &amp;&gt; theProcess.log &amp;
</pre>
<p>
Occasionally you'll realize that you don't want the jobs to run
anymore, so to kill them:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">kill %2
</pre>
</div>
<p>
where <code>%1</code> is the job number you are referencing.  You'll see
something like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[2]-  Terminated              myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 41 &amp;&gt; theProcess.log &amp;

<h4 id="sec-1-3-3">Configuring SSH</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
Many of these tips are <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/smylers/2011/08/ssh-productivity-tips.html">lifted from here</a>.
Put this in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
ControlPersist yes
ServerAliveInterval 30
ServerAliveCountMax 1
</pre>
<p>
It is possible to setup ssh shorthand to route you to remote
machines. The syntax (in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>) is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Host shortname
  #expands to shortname.remote.location.edu
  HostName %h.remote.location.edu 
  User username
  ForwardX11 yes #this is equivalient to ssh -Y
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa #path to your pubkey

<h5 id="sec-1-3-3-1">SSH Keys</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-3-1">
<p>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">Follow this guide</a>, stop at step 3.
Now, when you need to start using a new machine:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh-copy-id user@remote.machine.name
</pre>
<p>
Then enter your password.  Now, when you type <code>ssh
user@remote.machine.name</code> you will authenticate yourself with your
newly minted RSA key, and you won't have to enter your password.  The
downside is that you'll have to enter your key's passphrase to unlock
it. See below for a way to unlock it once per session.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b> While it is cryptographically more secure to authenticate
yourself with ssh keys, if your machine is compromised (ie stolen or
hacked) your ssh keys can provide the attacker with easier access to
all the machines you had access to.  This means you should:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use a strong pass <b>phrase</b>, not password.  You need to maximize the 
number of bits of entropy in your key in order to make it
difficult to crack should the keys fall into enemy hands.  
</li>
<li>Inform the admins of any machines you had access to if your
machine is compromised
</li>
<li>Encrypt your ssh keys (and other sensitive information) in a
private directory that only you can access
</li>
<li><b>NEVER EVER</b> store your ssh keys on a third party site (like
Dropbox or similar services)

<h5 id="sec-1-3-3-2">SSH Agent</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-3-2">
<p>
If you have ssh-agent running (through the <code>gnome-keyring</code> service on
Ubuntu, or directly in your .xinitrc through <code>ssh-agent blah</code>) you
can type <code>ssh-add</code> when you log in and it will add your ssh key to
the keyring, then you can ssh to any machine that you have copied
your key to without entering the password! 
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b> Once you've added your key to the ssh-agent, anyone can sit
down at your keyboard and log into a remote machine as you! This
means if you step away from your computer (even for a moment) you
should lock the screen or log out.

<h4 id="sec-1-3-4">Version Control Systems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-4">
<p>
The two major version control systems in HEP are Git and Subversion (svn).  These
are tools and utilities to allow collaboration on large pieces of
software.  
</p>

<p>
They also provide programmers with a convenient "paper trail" through
the course of developing a piece of software.  It allows them to
revert the source code they are working on to any state that they've
previously checked in.
</p>

<p>
Subversion is a successor of CVS, everything is stored on a remote
site, and your source code directory contains metadata about the
source code with reference to the remote site.  
</p>

<p>
Some subversion tutorials:
</p>

</li>
<li><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a> (A comprehensive free book about Subversion)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Git is a software that was written by Linus Torvalds, the hacker
behind Linux.  It was written to manage the Linux kernel, a massive
piece of software.  Git's model for managing source code is slightly
different.  In Git, you maintain the entire repository in your local
copy.  This makes committing, managing, and branching very fast.  It
also means you can work with all of the advantages of a version
control system without internet access.  Simultaneously there is a
copy of the repository on a remote server.  Git handles syncing these
two repositories when instructed.  This can lead to confusion if
you've used other versioning systems, but shouldn't be a problem if
you have no expectations.

<h4 id="sec-1-3-5">*rc Files</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-5">
<p>
<code>*rc</code> files are special files that are executed every time a program
starts. They almost exclusively live in the user's home directory,
and can be shadowed by the system.  Sometimes they have a special
syntax for setting options, sometimes they are written in a scripting
language.  The most relevant rc files for a new hitchhiker are:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> .rootrc </dt><dd>the file that sets root options
</dd>
<dt> .bashrc </dt><dd>this is executed every time you open a terminal in bash
</dd>
<dt> .tcshrc </dt><dd>as above but for tcsh (hopefully you aren't using this!)
</dd>
<dt> .zshrc </dt><dd>as above for the zsh shell
</dd>
<dt> .vimrc </dt><dd>configuration options for the venerable vim editor
</dd>
<dt> .screenrc </dt><dd>options for gnu screen
</dd>
<dt> .emacs </dt><dd>written in emacs lisp, is executed on startup, breaks the
rc naming scheme.  Advanced emacs users have
multi-thousand line rc files
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are other files, if you want to know about them you can do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">ls .*rc
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And google the ones that look interesting.  Alternatively you can look
at the system defaults:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">ls /etc/*rc
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Sometimes its useful to copy the system file to your home directory
and then edit it there in order to add your customizations.  Some
programs document their options that way.

<h3 id="sec-1-5">Editors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Like the major world religions, there are also major editors.  In
the *nix ecosystem there are two main editors: Emacs and Vim. There are
others, but they are many, and beyond the scope of this guide.  
</p>

<p>
The most important thing to do after <a href="https://mjambon.github.io/vim-vs-emacs/">choosing an editor</a> is to work
through its corresponding tutorial (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430164/differences-between-Emacs-and-vim">more pragmatic advice here</a>).  An
oft heard recommendation is that "Emacs is easier to learn than
vi(m)".  A more accurate statement may be that it is easier to make
things happen in Emacs than Vim, but the two editors are in some sense
the yin and yang of text. True enlightenment in either of these
editors takes roughly the same amount of time after completing the
corresponding tutorial.

<h4 id="sec-1-5-1">Finding an editor Guru</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">
<p>
After you have finished the tutorial for your editor of choice, then
it's time to find a guru.  Guru's are best located by asking around.
If you are talking with someone and notice they use your editor,
don't be afraid to ask them how they did something. Most of the time
the Guru will be flattered and may even volunteer to help you with
any other editor related questions.  
</p>

<h5 id="sec-1-5-1-1">Editor Guru etiquette</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-1-1">
<p>
While it is generally OK to ask your Guru any editor related
question, it is best to keep questions restricted to the editor in
question.  Flame wars have been fought for decades over which is the
"one true editor." 
</p>

<p>
In order to prevent a <i>faux pas</i>, it is best to make sure you know which
editor your guru uses.  This is especially true in the case of a
vi(m) or Emacs guru. 
</p>

<p>
Another thing to be careful of is repeatedly asking basic questions.
Again, some gurus will tolerate this at the beginning, but after a
point the guru expects you to master the basics (on your own). The
most valuable knowledge your guru can impart is not written in the
tutorial that came with the editor.

<p>
Guru's subsist mainly on a liquid diet of caffeinated beverages
during the day and beer (occasionally wine) at night.  It is
important that your Guru remain well lubricated. It is generally
considered a good gesture to offer your Guru his/her beverage of
choice if you've found him/her to be especially helpful on your path

<p>
The end goal of any student of the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/hacks/why-cooperation-with-rms-is-impossible.mp3">Church of Emacs</a> is to obtain
proficiency reprogramming the editor to solve the task at hand.  This
is ultimately stems from the philosophy of lisp (this gift was given
to us by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/saint.html">St. IGNUcious</a> an AI hacker from MIT where Emacs was born).
In lisp, the flexibility of the language allows it to be re-written to
solve the problem as clearly as possible.  In Emacs, an enlightened
user will write a substrate of elisp (Emacs' dialect of lisp) in order
to solve the editing problem at hand.

While customizing and writing your .emacs (the initialization file
loaded by Emacs in your home directory) is a spiritual journey, there

If Emacs is like Catholicism, then Vim is like Buddhism.  Vim is the
modern incarnation of vi, a modal text editor that descended from ed.
The modal way of editing is by expressing in a few keystrokes how the
text should be manipulated.  This is in contrast to Emacs, where text
is manipulated directly.  This fundamental difference is the source of
much confusion for new users, and is also why many people recommend
Emacs as "being easier to learn." This should not deter new users from
learning vi(m), as its editing facilities are substantial.
</p>

<p>
A functional <code>.vimrc</code> looks like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
syntax on
set cursorline
set hlsearch
set ic
set incsearch
set ruler
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
set wrap
</pre>

<p>
To learn Vim, type <code>vimtutor</code> at the command lime and follow the
instructions. Take your time, and repeat the tutorial once or twice
over a few days.  In the mean time editors such as <code>gedit</code> or <code>nano</code>
offer a more traditional experience.  As your Vim skills improve, you
will feel more comfortable with Vim and can stop using the less
powerful editors.

<h3 id="sec-1-7">A brief introduction to C++</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
C++ is the industry standard programming language for analysis in
HEP.  Even if you are fortunate enough to do most of your work in
Python, you will eventually be calling C++ code, and should
understand some core concepts in order to debug problems should they
arise.
</p>

<p>
Things to keep in mind: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This portion of the guide covers C++ at a high level.  Very little
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/tutorial">specific syntax</a> will be covered.  When you have a C++ question,
google is your friend.
</li>
<li>When writing in any language, prefer that languages idioms.  Don't
write python in C++, C in C++ or C++ in python.
</li>
<li>C++ is a vast language, however being familiar with its roots, C,
is invaluable.
</li>
<li>If faced with a decision between learning C++ vs Python, prefer
C++.  C++'s syntax is more rigid and requires more overhead.  Once
you know C++, python is much easier to pick up.
</li>
<li>There's always an exception to the rule, just make sure it's the
right exception!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
C++ is an imperative, object oriented language.  It started out as a
"C with classes" but has since bolted on significant language
features different from C.  Proficiency with C++ should be aimed
towards comfortable use of the template meta-programming features of
the language, although it is entirely possible to spend an entire
career writing C++ without exercising this feature (just read the ROOT
source code).

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-7-1">Pointers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-1">
<p>
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/cdescent/">Required Reading: The Descent to C</a>
</p>

<p>
As C++ has evolved from C, it retains parts of C's low level nature.
Part of this is the need to be explicit about managing memory
manually.  This is in stark contrast to languages such as Java or
Python where memory management is handled for the programmer.
</p>

<p>
A consequence of this is the ability to address specific cells of
memory (the smallest accessible unit, typically a byte).  An object
(<code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>string</code>, etc) may span several
memory cells.  A pointer is the computer's representation of a memory
cell's location in memory, ie a memory address.  Ultimately the
programmer is interested in the data contained in the set of memory
cells "pointed to" by the pointer.  The act of retrieving this data is
called "<i>dereferencing</i> a pointer".
</p>

<p>
As in physics, facility with manipulating pointers is best gained
through experience, however many analogies have been developed to ease
confusion.  One analogy is street addresses, A street address is a
sequence of numbers (the pointer) which instructs someone, a mailman
say, (the computer), how to find a specific location. Once at that
location, it is possible to manipulate objects located at that address
(deliver mail if your the mailman, break the mailbox if your a bored
teenager, knock on the door if you are a vacuum salesman etc).
</p>

<p>
Now some syntax:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">Foo* bar = new Foo("Baz",42,"What is the question?");
std::cout &lt;&lt; "object bar lives at memory address:"&lt;&lt;bar&lt;&lt;std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "bar calculated a question to the answer to \"The Ultimate Question\" as "&lt;&lt;bar-&gt;TheAnswer()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt;"Another way to get the answer is: "&lt;&lt;(*bar).TheAnswer()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Lots of interesting things have been introduced here.  Let's look at a
possible output of this program:
</p>
<pre class="example">
object bar lives at memory address: 0xd29ad0
bar calculated a question to the answer to "The Ultimate Question" as "What is 6x9?"
Another way to get the answer is: "What is 6x9?"
</pre>
<p>
What happened? Let's look at the first line
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">Foo* bar = new Foo("Baz",42,"What is the question?");
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>Foo*</code> is a pointer of type <code>Foo</code>. It's an address to a chunk of memory
that contains an instance of <code>Foo</code>.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Question: Why does the compiler need to know that it's a Foo type object at that address? 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Answer: Foo might fall across several memory cells, in which case the
compiler must know how many memory cells to move if you ask for the
bar+1 spot. In fact, in C there is a concept called the void*, a
type-less pointer that is an address to anything.  It is the
programmer's responsibility to cast the void* to the correct type.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so we have a pointer to an object of type <code>Foo</code> called <code>bar</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Question: What happens on the right hand side of the assignment operator (=)?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Answer: C++ reserves the keyword "new" for memory allocation.  The
"new" keyword takes a class constructor on the right hand side, and
returns a memory address on the left hand side.  This address gets
stored in the variable <code>bar</code>.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Operationally, the "new" keyword allocates a chunk of memory to hold
the object on the right hand side, and returns a pointer to the
beginning of the chunk.  
</p>

<p>
What happens when we want to access the memory that the pointer points
to? There is another operation called "dereferencing" which goes to
the address pointed to and returns the object contained at that point
in memory.  Consider the following snippet:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">double* foo = new double(3.14159);
double pi = *foo;
std::cout &lt;&lt;"Pi is: "&lt;&lt;pi&lt;&lt;std::endl;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here, a chunk of memory has the value 3.14159 written to it, then
that value is retrieved and stored in another location of memory
called <code>pi</code>.  That data is the written out the terminal by
<code>std::cout</code> and <code>std::endl</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now we can understand this line:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">std::cout &lt;&lt;"Another way to get the answer is: "&lt;&lt;(*bar).TheAnswer()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
It means, retrieve the object pointed to by <code>bar</code>, and call the method
"<code>TheAnswer()</code>" on it.  Programmers abhor syntax that can easily get
them into trouble, so the language designers (of c) added a shorthand
for this kind of operation (the <code>-&gt;</code> operator):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">Foo* bar=new Foo();
if(bar-&gt;Value()==(*bar).Value()){
  std::cout&lt;&lt;"They're the same!"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Quiz: What will the output of this snippet be?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7-1-1" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sec-1-7-1-1">Why are pointer's useful at all?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-7-1-1">
<p>
Clever hitchhikers will notice that this appears to be a bunch of
bureaucratic mucking about with pointless details, most of the time it
is.  Since most of HEP deals with pointless details bureaucratically,
a lot of HEP code uses pointers.
</p>

<p>
To understand the real purpose of pointers, we must examine <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146094/why-should-i-use-a-pointer-rather-than-the-object-itself?newsletter=1&nlcode=47931|9e27">dynamic
allocation</a>. Consider the following code:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">double* foo(){
  double* bar = new double(0.0);

  {
    double baz=42;
    *bar=baz;//dereference bar, and store the value of baz 
  }
  //baz is out of scope
  return bar;
}
int main(void){
  double* foobar=foo();
  std::cout &lt;&lt;"The Answer to the Ultimate question is :"&lt;&lt;*foobar&lt;&lt;std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Let's execute the code in our mind:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>execute <code>main(void)</code>
</li>
<li>a <code>double*</code> named <code>foobar</code> is allocated.
</li>
<li><code>foo()</code> is executed
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a <code>double*</code> named <code>bar</code> is allocated
</li>
<li>new initializes a <code>double</code> with value 0.0
</li>
<li>new assigns the address containing that <code>double</code> to <code>bar</code>
</li>
<li>enter the braces, intialize a <code>double</code> named <code>baz</code> with value 42
</li>
<li>dereference <code>bar</code> and copy the value of <code>baz</code> into it
</li>
<li>exit the braces and free the memory where <code>baz</code> was
</li>
<li>return the address containing the value of <code>bar</code>;
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assign the value returned by <code>foo()</code> to <code>foobar</code>
</li>
<li>stream the string "The Answer&#x2026;" to stdout
</li>
<li>dereference <code>*foobar</code> to obtain the value stored at <code>bar</code>, 42, stream
that to stdout
</li>
<li>add a newline to the output and flush the result to the terminal
with <code>std::endl</code>

<h5 id="sec-1-7-1-2">References</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-7-1-2">
<p>
A similar concept present in C++ (but not c) are references.  They can
be thought of as aliases (the way Dave is an alias of David). Their
syntax is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">int foo=42;
int&amp; theAnswer=foo;
foo=0;
std::cout&lt;&lt;theAnswer&lt;&lt;std::endl;

</div>
<p>
Here foo is initialized to the value 42, then a reference named
theAnswer is declared and assigned to foo.  All this does is make a
new name for the same object.  What does the program output?
</p>

<p>
The answer is 0.  References seem pointless (pun intended) until
they're used in function definitions:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">void bar(int&amp; foo){
  //complicated calculation for foo
  foo++;
}
int main(void){
  int baz=41;

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-7-2">Methods</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-2">
<p>
Methods, or functions are defined as:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">return_type function_name(arg1_type arg1, arg2_type arg2, ...){
  //statements that define function_name
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
It is possible to "forward declare" functions, these are "promises to
the compiler" that you have a function with a particular signature:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">double foo(double,double);
// important other stuff
double foo(double theta, double phi){
  return sin(theta)*sin(theta) + cos(phi)*cos(phi);
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Notice that the compiler doesn't need to know the names of the
arguments in the forward declaration.  
</p>

<p>
Before we move onto the next topic, a note on methods.  Most of the
time during development, you only have a few helper functions.  This
is fine! Just write your helper functions in a header file, and
include them.  Write the main function and move on with your life.
There are many examples in HEP, where methods have been pigeon-holed
into classes.  The result is a cumbersome interface for the user
(YOU!) or more importantly your supervisor.  With that in mind, lets
move on to classes.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-3">
<p>
STOP! Read the last paragraph of the previous section.  
</p>

<p>
Now, ask yourself: Do I really need a class?  
No. Ok, great!
</p>

<p>
Yes. Are you sure?  Maybe your needs are better served with a few
functions and a well defined interface.
</p>

<p>
Do you have complicated data structures that need to be operated on
by many methods? No? Maybe your needs are better served with a few

<p>
Yes? Maybe you should rethink your design.

<p>
You've rethought it and realized that you have to use a class because
the person before you did, now there isn't a clean way to do it any
other way.  OK, classes.

<blockquote>
<p>
Editor's Note: Our dear reader may have been studying this guide and
thought to themselves: "Gee wiz, there is a lot of great advice here,
I should follow this exactly or dragons might eat my analysis
program!"  While this may be a possibility, the previous advice on
classes may be a little, well, misguided.
</p>

<p>
More sound advice may sound like this: When beginning development,
make your first (and maybe second) drafts of the program without
classes.  This will force you to recognize which parts of your program
fit together (data+methods) and which are separate.  Then, revise your
program to include classes with the appropriate encapsulation of data
and methods.  This will ensure that you write a clean interface, and
that you don't end up with 20 methods that all take the same four
arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The basic syntax is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">class A{
public:
  A():a(0),b(0){};
  A(int _a):a(_a),b(0){};
  ~A(){};
  void SetA(int new_a){a=new_a;};
  void GetA(){return a;};
  void SetB(int new_b){b=new_b;};
  void GetB(){return b;};
private:
  int a;
protected:
  int b;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is a trivial example, and it breaks many rules about naming
conventions and clarity.  It is not a good example.  It should not be
used as a good example to win arguments about concise code.  In fact,
you probably shouldn't have read it.
</p>

<p>
Important features of the code: Anything after the public keyword is
accessible to the outside world, ie:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">A myObj;
myObj.SetA(10);
myObj.GetA();
myObj.SetB(42);
myObj.GetB();
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Is all valid code, anything that is written after private, is just
that.  You cannot access it outside of the class:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">myObj.a; //Compiler error
myObj.b; //protected is a special form of private
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The protected keyword is for class inheritance.  It says that these
variables and methods are private for users of the class, but if
another class inherits from this one, they inherit these symbols. 
</p>

<p>
Normally in class inheritance, you only inherit the public members of
the class.  The private members are not inherited.  Protected offers
a way to encapsulate data, but also share data among inheritance
diagrams.
</p>

<p>
In case you haven't picked up on it, classes are one of the hairier
aspects of C++.  It's better if you refer to some other resource for a
tutorial on classes, as their subtleties are beyond the scope of The
Guide.

For better or worse, for richer or poorer (always poorer), HEP
Physicists are married to (read: stuck with) ROOT.  It's the <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~weise/uhh-download.html">Unix</a> of
HEP.  There is method in the madness, though it is not clear what the
method is (just yet). The Editor is fairly certain that ROOT uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistromath#Bistromathic_drive">Bistromath</a>ics for many of its statistical operations.
</p>

<p>
ROOT is the industry standard tool for analyzing and manipulating gobs
of data.  Other statistical analysis tools <a href="http://www.matthewckeller.com/html/memory.html">crash and burn</a> on the
datasets that ROOT eats for breakfast.  
</p>

<p>
Recently, ROOT has begun the transition from the 5 series to the 6
series. This transition has resulted in huge changes to the front and
back-end of ROOT. Below there will be some comparisons to both
versions.  When something applies to the 5 series, it will be
annotated ROOTv5.  It should be assumed that ROOT or ROOTv6 refers to
the newest 6 series.  Without further ado, let's set it up and get to
work!

"pro" version.  It appears that in ROOT 6, the developers have stopped
releasing windows builds. This means that to use ROOT 6 and above

</p>

<p>
When choosing a version of ROOT, always pick the 'pro' (pro for
production) version.  It's the latest, stable, version recommended by
the ROOT Devs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nota Bene</b> If you're doing this on Mac OS, you'll need to use <code>brew

will probably be different.

<p>
If you haven't yet, read the <i>section of the guide</i> relevant to your OS.

<p>
For our install of ROOT, we'll be compiling and running it locally.
This has a few advantages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Uninstalling" is easy, either unset the environment variables
pointing to ROOT, or completely delete the folder that root lives
in (in this example <code>~/root</code>)
</li>
<li>Having multiple versions side-by-side is possible, you could have:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>~/root-clang</code> a version of root compiled with clang
</li>
<li><code>~/root-5.34</code> a stable version of ROOT
</li>
<li><code>~/root-5.99</code> the beta version of ROOT 6
</li>
<li>To use any of them you would just have to source
<code>~/root-ver/bin/thisroot.sh</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don't need root (administrative) access on the machine (as long
as the pre-req's are installed).  This is generally nice since it
decouples ROOT from the hosting OS.  
</li>

Now, all of the following information is documented at
<i>root.cern.ch</i>, but it is even less organized than this guide. The
following is a straight-shot from no source code to a fully working
ROOT binary on a clean install of Ubuntu (currently 13.10, but the
build process has been stable for the last ~3 years)
</p>

<p>
End to end, this takes ~40min on a machine circa 2011, so budget some
coffee time.

<p>
You may have some of these packages already if you've installed
<code>build-essential</code> or <code>git</code> before.  In either case, <code>apt</code> is smart
enough to see that and not re-install them. 
</p>

<p>
The above list of packages are for a full-blown,
all-features-enabled  version of ROOT.  If you want a stripped down
version, you'll have to get the pre-reqs from <a href="http://root.cern.ch">http://root.cern.ch</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Alternatively you can type:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">sudo apt-get build-dep root-system
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And let <code>apt</code> install and manage any dependencies ROOT needs.  This
is overkill, even for a "bells and whistles" build of ROOT.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-2-2" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sec-1-9-2-2">May the Source be with you</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-2-2">
<p>
Let's get a copy of the source:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/root.git
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For future reference, if you want to update:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">git pull
git tag -l 
git checkout -b tag-name tag-name
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>git tag -l</code> lists all the available tags, choose the one you want
and substitute it for <code>tag-name</code>
</p>

<p>
For now, lets checkout the latest pro branch:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">git checkout -b v6-04-14 v6-04-14
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will checkout the branch <code>v6-04-14</code> to a local branch <code>v6-04-14</code>
and switch you to it. If you're new to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_systems">version control systems</a>", or
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_management">source control management</a>" then it's useful to do a tutorial to learn
the basics.  In HEP, the major system used is called SVN, in open
source, Git has become the de facto standard almost overnight.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-2-3" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sec-1-9-2-3">Building</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-2-3">
<p>
With our code checked out and ready, we need to configure it to match
the computer we're compiling on.  To do this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">./configure --all
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To see all options run <code>./configure --help</code>, this command suggests
piping the output to <code>more</code>, but most "modern" terminal emulators have
a scroll-back buffer large enough that you can just scroll up and read
the output.  The <code>--all</code> option instructs configure to enable support
for as many packages as your system supports.  If you require a
specific feature (say roofit) you would type:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">./configure [other options] --enable-roofit
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you're interested in building ROOT with xrootd (network protocol
which allows opening root files over a network connection) see
<a href="#sec-1-9-3">Advanced Build Options</a>.
</p>

<p>
After configuring you should see:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Enabled support for asimage, astiff, builtin_afterimage, builtin_llvm, explicitlink, fftw3, gviz, gdml, genvector, http, krb5, ldap, mathmore, memstat, minuit2, mysql, opengl, python, qt, qtgsi, roofit, search_usrlocal, shadowpw, shared, sqlite, ssl, table, tmva, unuran, vc, vdt, x11, xft, xml.

To build ROOT type:

   make
</pre>

<p>
Now type <code>make</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">make -j 4
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <code>-j</code> option tells make how many jobs it can run simultaneously.
Without <code>-j</code>, only one job runs.  A good rule of thumb is to choose
the number of cores you have on your computer.  If you are compiling
on remote computer, it is probably shared by others, in which it is
good etiquette to run your jobs single threaded.  On your laptop, you
should choose <b>one less</b> than the number of cores you have (so you
don't notice a slow-down while its building in the background).
</p>

<p>
See <code>man make</code> and look under the option "-j [jobs]" for more
detailed information about this switch.
</p>

<p>
This will take (depending on your hardware) between 20-45min, so now
is a good time for a cup of tea, or coffee with your <i>editor guru</i>.
</p>

<p>
When it's finished, it will print out:
</p>
<pre class="example">

   ============================================================
   ===                ROOT BUILD SUCCESSFUL.                ===

<p>
If you do not get this message, but the build just ends with <code>[lots of

<code>[lots of boring crap]</code> (it won't be boring to them). They will be
able to instruct you on what went wrong. 
</p>

<p>
If you don't have a senior grad student handy, try googling some of
the output and seeing if you can get anywhere.  There is also the

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-2-4">
<p>
Now, when you want to use <code>root</code>, you can run the command:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">source ~/root/bin/thisroot.sh
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you are using tcsh (you shouldn't be) you would need to run:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">source ~/root/bin/thisroot.csh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are differing opinions about whether or not you should put
something like this in your bashrc.  One school of thought (especially
applicable when you bounce between different versions) is that you
should keep your environment as clean as possible and only setup what
you need.  In that case adding:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">alias setupROOT='source ${HOME}/root/bin/thisroot.sh'
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file is enough.
</p>

<p>
Then, whenever you need root, you have to run <code>setupROOT</code>, before you
can run <code>root</code>.
</p>

<p>
Another school of thought is that, you should always have some copy
of root available if possible.  In that case the following will
always setup root when bash runs if the setup file exists:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">[ -f ~/root/bin/thisroot.sh ] &amp;&amp; source ~/root/bin/thisroot.sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can start root by typing <code>root</code> at the command line.  You
should see:

To start root without the splash screen type <code>root -l</code> in which case
you see:

<p>
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-xrootd">Full instructions here</a>
</p>

<p>
If you want to use xrootd, you'll also need cmake:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">apt-get install cmake
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then, (from the directory where you checked out <code>root</code>):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">./build/unix/installXrootd.sh
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will install xrootd to whatever directory you're currently in,
so if you want it installed somewhere else, cd to that directory
first, just make sure that you update the location in the next command.
</p>

<p>
Now when you configure root you should use:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">./configure --all --with-xrootd=${HOME}/root/xrootd-4.2.1/
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here <code>${HOME}/root/xrootd-4.2.1/</code> is the path where xrootd was
installed (based on the <code>installXrootd.sh</code> script above).  If you
blindly follow the instructions the above command will "just work".
</p>

<p>
<b>Nota Bene</b> The path following <code>--with-xrootd=</code> must be a fully
qualified path (ie <code>/home/username/root/xrootd-4.2.1/</code>), the
configure script doesn't understand that <code>~/</code> is a shorthand for
<code>${HOME}</code>. 
</p>

<p>
if <code>xrootd</code> support has been enabled you should see:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Enabled support for asimage, astiff, builtin_afterimage, builtin_llvm, explicitlink, fftw3, gviz, gdml, genvector, http, krb5, ldap, mathmore, memstat, minuit2, mysql, opengl, python, qt, qtgsi, roofit, search_usrlocal, shadowpw, shared, sqlite, ssl, table, tmva, unuran, vc, vdt, x11, xft, xml, xrootd.

To build ROOT type:

   make
</pre>

<p>
Make sure you see <code>xrootd</code> in the list! If not xrootd won't be
installed and won't function properly. You can now continue with the
<i>regular instructions</i>. <b>Note</b>: If you want to be able to access files
hosted at CERN, you'll have to have a kerberos client installed
(either <code>krb5-user</code> or <code>heimdal-clients</code> on debian or ubuntu systems).  Then
before connecting, run <code>kinit -5 ${CERN_USER}@CERN.CH</code> to generate a
kerberos certificate.

There are three methods of running code through ROOT to produce
results.  These methods are listed below, each more sophisticated
than the last.  They also include example code intended as a starting
point for hacking.

<h5 id="sec-1-9-4-1">Level 1: Macros</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-4-1">
<p>
The first, and simplest way to execute ROOT related code is the
humble macro. A macro is a set of ROOT commands enclosed by
braces. For example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">{
  TFile* file= TFile::Open("MeaningOfLife.root");
  TH1F* hist = (TH1F*)file-&gt;Get("Hist1");
  cout &lt;&lt; hist-&gt;GetNbinsX() &lt;&lt;endl;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<b>For ROOT 6:</b>
ROOTv6 macros are compiled with the LLVM backend "just in time"
(JIT). This means that you have to type valid C++ in order to make
things work correctly.  This alleviates a lot of the issues that make
Macros fragile, and so it is easier to transition from Level 1 to
Level 2, and you can achieve more with a macro than before.
</p>

<p>
<b>For ROOT 5:</b>
While not immediately obvious, ROOTv5 macros are not written in C or
C++, but <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint">CINT</a>. CINT covers "most of"   ANSI C and ISO C++ 2003.
There are some important differences:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>foo.blah</code> and <code>foo-&gt;blah</code> are interchangeable
</li>
<li>a semicolon ';' at the end of a line is optional
</li>
<li>No need to "<code>#include</code>" headers
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you progress in writing more sophisticated C++, you will run into
CINT's shortcomings as a C++ interpreter.  It is recommended that you
move to Level 2 or 3 before this happens. 
</p>

<p>
While it is possible to write complicated CINT macros (files with
multiple function definitions) it is not recommended.  CINT has a
habit of keeping up the appearance of doing one thing when in reality
something entirely different is happening "behind the scenes".
</p>

<p>
CINT is best used for quick scripts to plot histograms already saved
to a disk, or to inspect a few branches from a <code>TTree</code>.  More
sophisticated analyses are better served by Levels 2 and 3. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-4-2" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sec-1-9-4-2">Level 2: Compiled Macros</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-4-2">
<p>
Compiled macros are full-blown C++ programs.  Generally there is a
"steering macro" that handles compiling and loading the required
libraries.  An example steering macro:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">{
  //may need to load other libraries or files that depend on analysis.C
  gROOT-&gt;ProcessLine(".L analysis.C++");
  gROOT-&gt;ProcessLine("doAnalysis()");
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The compiled macro itself looks more like a traditional C++ program:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include "TFile.h"
#include "TH1F.h"

int doAnalysis(){

  return 42;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Since the ROOT binary already defines a "main" an error will occur
if you redefine another function named "main", therefore we use
the verb "doAnalysis". 
</p>

<p>
The steering macro that compiles each source file can become
arbitrarily complex.  To some this may read "flexible", to others it
may read "disorganized".  If your analysis grows into a multi-file
program, it's probably time to ascend to Level 3.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-4-3" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sec-1-9-4-3">Level 3: Compiled Programs</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-9-4-3">
<p>
A compiled program is just that. Here ROOT takes the role of a rich
set of libraries for composing a C++ based analysis.  
</p>

<p>
An example program (and supporting Makefile) <a href="https://github.com/dbjergaard/hitchhikers-guide-to-hep/tree/master/compiled-program">is included here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Makefiles come with their own overhead, but the <code>make</code> system is very
powerful.  The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make manual</a> is very readable with many examples.

PyROOT are a set of python bindings to ROOT. It works fairly well out
of the box, but there are some things to keep in mind. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Idiomatic python avoids "<code>from ROOT import *</code>", prefer "<code>from ROOT
  import blah</code>"
</li>
<li>the ROOT devs know you aren't going to be idiomatic, so instead
they've implemented a lazy loading system (ROOT is huge, so "<code>from
  ROOT import *</code>" would take forever).  This may be confusing if your
a python expert and expect exploration commands like <code>dir()</code> to
work with ROOT.
</li>
<li>If performance matters, try to stay in C++ land (ie call C++
functions from python) as much as possible
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If performance really matters, write it in python and then port
it to C++. This is fairly advanced, but not impossible. You'll
have to generate CINT dictionaries for your source files.

A well designed graph is truly a work of art. The path from paltry
graphics spit out by ROOT to something worthy of framing (and yes,
<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters">truly amazing data visualizations are routinely framed</a>) is long and
fraught with naysayers who will insist that you are doing it wrong.
Ignore them, and do what needs to be done to communicate your hard won
data clearly and concisely.  To get you started, give "<a href="http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~rbm/cs100/notes/spreadsheets/tufte_paper.html">Principles of
Information Display for Visualization Practitioners</a>" a read.  It is an
executive summary of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte's</a> works on visualizing information.
If what you read resonates with you, then please read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142">Tufte's books</a>.
They make for delightful coffee time distractions.  After reading his
books you will start to see his influence in particularly nice
graphics.  You will also see many sins committed by other
practitioners in our field. Choose your role-models wisely.

<p>
Sage advice (passed down from The Editor's first mentor):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When you make a plot, take the time to make it publication quality
and reproducible.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This means two things:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make it good enough to go into a paper
</li>
<li>Prefer generating it with C++/Python over any other format (data
inputs will frequently change at the last minute, and being able to
"hit a button" and get the plot is very useful unless you have a
room full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">Mechanical Turks</a> lying around)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This also means it's probably a good idea to keep <code>*.root</code> files
containing your histograms for last minute style changes if you are
writing a presentation.
</p>

<p>
Producing a publication quality plot can be challenging, however ROOT
includes the concept of a "Style" which can be applied.  These are
global rules for how plots should be printed.  In previous versions of
ROOT, the default style was notoriously bad.  In The Editor's humble
opinion, this was done to simultaneously encourage each physicist to
set their own standard, and to immediately identify ROOT newbies from
seasoned ROOT hackers.
</p>

<p>
Now, things are better, though the idea that "each physicist set their
own standard" has stuck, and so there are many styles floating
around.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-9-8">Extending ROOT with custom classes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-8">
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to add your own developed classes to ROOT (so
they can be used in ROOT macros/PyROOT scripts or so they can be
stored in a ROOT file). For example you may have a class of the form
(in a file called CustomEvent.h, for example):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">#ifndef CustomEvent_h
#define CustomEvent_h

#include "TObject.h"

class CustomEvent : public TObject {
  ClassDef(CustomEvent,1);
private:
  int    _eventID;
  double _eventEnergy;
public:
  CustomEvent() {}
  virtual ~CustomEvent() {}

  void set_eventID(const int eid);
  void set_eventEnergy(const double e);

  int eventID() const { return _eventID; }
  double eventEnergy() const { return _eventEnergy; }
};

#endif
</pre>
</div>
<p>
It is a good idea to inherit from TObject if you require reading or
writing objects to disk.  Official documentation of the ins and outs
of adding classes can be found in Chapter 15 of the <a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/root-users-guide-534">User's Guide</a>, as
well as information here: <a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/interacting-shared-libraries-rootcint">cint</a> and <a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/adding-your-class-root-classdef">ClassDef</a>.  We also need
CustomEvent.cxx:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">#include "CustomEvent.h"

CustomEvent::CustomEvent() {}
CustomEvent::~CustomEvent() {}

void CustomEvent::set_eventID(const int eid) { _eventID = eid; }
void CustomEvent::set_eventEnergy(const double e) { _eventEnergy = e; }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To make this class accessible within (Py)ROOT you must create a LinkDef.h file
of the form:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">#ifdef __CINT__
#pragma link off all globals;
#pragma link off all classes;
#pragma link off all functions;

#pragma link C++ class CustomEvent+;

#endif
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now you must generate a dictionary for the class:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">rootcint -f CustomEventDictionary.cxx -c CustomEvent.h LinkDef.h
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This generates <code>CustomEventDictionary.cxx</code> and
<code>CustomEventDictionary.h</code>. Now you can compile the source for your
class and the new dictionary source. Then finally link them together
in a library:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">g++ -fPIC -c CustomEvent.cxx `root-config --cflags`
g++ -fPIC -c CustomEventDictionary.cxx `root-config --cflags`
g++ -shared -o libCustomEvent.so CustomEvent.o CustomEventDictionary.o `root-config --glibs`
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now by loading the library libCustomEvent.so you can use your class
within ROOT. For example, the macro:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">{
  gSystem-&gt;Load("libCustomEvent");
  CustomEvent a;
  a.set_eventID(42);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; a.eventID() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

At some point you'll get stuck.  Hopefully you'll be stuck on a good
problem, but more often than not you'll be stuck on some quirk that
ROOT has.  Remember ROOT's mantra: "<a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/f/feature.html">It's not a bug, it's a feature</a>!"
</p>

<p>
ROOT's object protocol is very strange.  The <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/c-coding-conventions">naming schema</a> is based on
an industry standard for C programs where it's not possible to use
namespaces. The result is very confusing for new users (very good for
HEP).  Every object in root that can be written to disk (ie saved in a
ROOT file) derives from a <code>TObject</code> base class.  This base class
defines a protocol for objects. (All objects can print themselves,
have a name, have a title, have a class name, etc).  This makes it
possible to have a list of disparate objects (as long as it's a list of
<code>TObject*</code>).  As you gain more experience with ROOT, this becomes
a power tool.  Like any power tool (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Home_Improvement_characters#Tim_Taylor">as Tim Taylor can attest</a>), this
can be abused to no end.

<code>THStack(const TH1* hist, Option_t* axis = "x", ...)</code>

Another, slightly more direct option is <code>TH2::ProjectionX()</code> and

Depending on your ROOT version, you may have to change the ="<sub>py</sub>"=
string to be something unique.  This can be done as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

TFile's are greedy about object ownership.  In fact, object ownership
in ROOT is a very common <del>bug</del> feature.  Many times you'll own objects
you thought you didn't (memory leak) or, you'll delete objects you
thought you did (double free core-dump). 
</p>

<p>
The rule of thumb to keep in mind is "TObjects declared after a file
is opened are owned by previously opened file" 
</p>

<p>
Contrast:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">TH1F hist("hist","Higgs Discovery Plot", 50,0,200);
TFile output("discovery.root","RECREATE");
output.Close();

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-cpp">TFile output("discovery.root","RECREATE");
TH1F hist("hist","Higgs Discovery Plot", 50,0,200);
output.Close();
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the former, the file <code>discovery.root</code> will be empty.  In the
latter, it will contain a copy of <code>hist</code>.  
</p>

<p>
This can get really hairy when you're dealing with pointers.
Therefore (instead of being a responsible programmer), the best
approach to managing memory in ROOT is to not manage it until you
have to.

Here's a tip you hope you never need.  The use case is when you are
writing a standalone program and you know you need to invoke rootcint
to generate dictionaries. When you follow the <a href="https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/interacting-shared-libraries-rootcint">correct prescription</a>,
the produced dictionary fails even when linked to your code.  What you
can do is follow the "<a href="https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=10236&p=83570#p44117">loader.C prescription</a>" and then dump what ACLiC
is doing under the hood with:
</p>
<pre class="example">
root [7] gDebug=7
(const int)7
root [8] .L libLoader.C++

This will dump all of the g++ and rootcint calls that are required to

<p>
This strips out the system calls that clutter the full trace, and the
top frame (#5 in this case) is the last function called that was
defined (<code>UnfoldingStudy::ExecuteEvent</code>).  This means that somewhere in
that function, someone tried to access memory they shouldn't have.

You can trace the whole program from the <code>main()</code> invocation.  To
gain more insight into all the information contained in the stack

Halzen and Martin has a better treatment of Quantum Chromodynamics,
but that just adds another book to your library.

This assumes the reader has covered the material in chapter 4 in a
undergraduate quantum course (at the level of Griffiths).  Chapter 4
is too much of a review to be useful as a primary source.  Griffith's
quantum book covers it, but Townsend's "A Modern Approach to Quantum

HEP uses cylindrical coordinates (well, a combination of cylindrical
and spherical really) with the z axis oriented along the beam line, R
radially "up" and the &phi; curling right-handed around the beam axis.
</p>

<p>
In addition, HEP physicists think in terms of a variable called
"pseudorapidity" denoted &eta;.  This is defined as 
$$
\eta = - \log\left(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
$$
Where &theta; is the polar angle from the beam azis. Why use this
crazy coordinate system? Well, it's related to rapidity,  the
relativistic counterpart to speed.  More important to HEP experiments,
<i>differences</i> in pseudorapidity are Lorentz invariant <i>along the beam
axis</i>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-10-3">
<p>
This is taken from The Editor's Lab Notebook (which is locked by a
password, and hence will only be read by one person):
</p>

<p>
Someone generates gobs of MC for use in any analysis for some process
( \(W\rightarrow \mu\nu+p\) where \(p\) is a parton).  I want to study what
a variable will look like in data, so I run my analysis over the MC
and get a plot out.  Then I run the same code over data and plot the
two on top of each other.  The trouble is that the number of MC events
I ran over is not the same as the amount of data I ran over.  Now the
problem becomes how to appropriately scale the Monte Carlo prediction
to match the data (the result of the experiment).
</p>

<p>
As experimental high energy physicists, we define variables so that we
can relate the cross sections predicted by theory to what we measure
out of the beam.  To this end, we can get the number of expected
events from
</p>
\begin{equation}
N_{D}=\sigma \mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
<p>
Here \(\sigma\) is the cross section in barns (typically pico-barns) and
\(\mathcal{L}\) is the integrated luminosity collected by the
experiment. How do we compare this to the Monte Carlo prediction?
There, the computer counts up the number of events that were generated
for a specific process, what we want is
</p>
\begin{equation}
N_{exp}=W N_{MC}
\end{equation}
<p>
Here \(N_{exp}\) is the expected number of events we get from Data.  In
order to compare data to MC we need to scale \(N_{exp}\) to the same
order as \(N_{D}\).  Remember, there is a cross section calculated from
theory that the MC prediction used, therefore we can write
</p>
\begin{equation}
N_{exp}=\sigma_{MC}\mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
<p>
It is possible that \(\sigma_{MC}\) is corrected to the next order.  In
order to avoid recalculating everything, a \(k\) factor is reported as
the ratio of \(\sigma_{NLO}/\sigma_{MC}\).  Then all you have to do is
multiply \(\sigma_{MC}\) by the \(k\) factor, and the calculation is
updated to the newest NLO prediction.
</p>

<p>
We're interested in the weight, so
</p>
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{\sigma_{MC}k\mathcal{L}}{N_{MC}}
\end{equation}
<p>
Now, when each bin in the Monte Carlo histogram is scaled by W, it
will be equal to the theoretically expected yield calculated by
\(\sigma_{MC}k\).

JaxoDraw comes as a jar file, you may want to make it more command

<pre class="src src-sh">chmod +x ${HOME}/local/bin/jaxodraw

<p>
And add it to your <code>PATH</code>. I have my path set up to search this path
from my <code>.bashrc</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH

Now to test it out by typing <code>jaxodraw</code> at the command prompt, it should
just launch. If it doesn't try again.

One option is to keep a (well organized) text file for recording what
you're doing.  Paste links and your thoughts here.  Choose a markdown
language and write your posts in that.  This way you are forced to
keep more structure in the file, and you can export to whatever
output formats are supported by your markdown language.

Some research groups reserve webspace for hosting private
e-logs. These are typically wiki syntax, but they can also be
bulletin board style formatting.  In any case, it's possible to use a
browser extension like "<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/its-all-text/">It's All Text!</a>"  to use your favorite
editor. One downside to these style notebooks is that it is typically
awkward to post many plots at once.

For better or worse, eventually you will get stuck.  This is
Research! If you're not stuck half the time you're not doing it
right! 
</p>

<p>
Here's a rough strategy for tackling problems:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Google it, don't just Google specific errors, search related terms.
Eventually you will be able to make the search more and more
general until you get the answer you want, try reading the <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/">Google
guide</a>.
</li>
<li>Read documentation. Many times the answer is buried deep inside
the program.  Don't be afraid to crack open the source code and
actually try to understand whats going on (after exhausting any
manuals or user guides available).
</li>
<li>Just take a deep breath, go get a cup of coffee and come back
to the problem.
</li>
<li>If the coffee didn't help, table the problem for the moment and
work on something else.  Most likely when you come back to it
(today or tomorrow) the solution will be obvious.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now may be an appropriate time for an email to the person you
are working with directly.  Chances are they've already
encountered and solved your problem.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you're still stuck, it may be time to post to a forum or mailing
list.  In general, when soliciting help from people you don't
know, it is polite to avoid contacting them directly.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Above all else, <b>do not</b> be a <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help vampire</a>.  (They do exist!)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<li>I tried: <code>#include &lt;TheAnswerIsFortyTwo.h&gt;</code> in C++ but it
doesn't work, what gives?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In short: "<code>#include &lt;...&gt;</code>" instructs the compiler to look in
specific system include directories.  In contrast '<code>#include</code> "<code>...</code>"'
instructs the compiler to look in all directories that it can find
(usually specified with the <code>-I</code> flag). (<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/43444/">Further information</a>)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was typing along and all of the sudden my terminal froze!? The
only way to continue was to exit the program! 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most likely you accidentally typed "C-s" (the control key followed by
the s key). This sends the XOFF command to your terminal emulator.
To fix it (and "unfreeze" your terminal) type "C-q". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_flow_control">More Info Here</a>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dear Mr. The Editor, my &lt;insert problem here&gt;, can you fix it?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
No. Please refer to <a href="#sec-1-12">Getting Help</a>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have some information that would be useful for your guide, can
you use it?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes! Please see <a href="https://github.com/dbjergaard/hitchhikers-guide-to-hep#contributing">Contributing</a>. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm lost and confused, your guide is overwhelming and overbearing,
but I really like HEP, what can I do?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please don't despair, with time things will come into focus.  In the
mean time, it will probably be useful to seek out other sources of
information.  If you're having trouble finding material, you might
try the <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/">Google guide</a>.  No, this is not intended to be an insult, a
surprising fraction of people don't know how to use Google, even
though it's a verb.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have a question not covered by this FAQ that doesn't involve a
research problem, whats the best way to communicate it to you?
